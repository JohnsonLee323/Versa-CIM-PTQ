# Versa-CIM-PTQ
Versa-CIM-PTQ is a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework specifically developed to support compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures. This framework offers the flexibility to adaptively adjust the quantization precision across different network layers and can automatically search for the optimal Exponent/Mantissa Ratio (EMR) under a given quantization precision based on the MSE distance between tensors.
